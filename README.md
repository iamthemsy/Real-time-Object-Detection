# Real-time-Object-Detection

#### Developed a real-time object detection application using Tkinter for GUI and OpenCV for video capture.
#### Implemented MobileNet SSD model for accurate object detection, processing frames from webcam in real- time.
#### Designed user interface with buttons for starting/stopping video and object detection processes.
#### Integrated Tkinter for GUI and PIL for image processing, displaying real-time object detection results.
#### Utilized OpenCVâ€™s DNN module to process video frames, apply object detection, and draw bounding boxes.
#### Ensured smooth operation by handling video capture, frame processing, and user interactions seamlessly.
#### Technologies Used : Python, OpenCV, Tkinter, MobileNet SSD etc.
